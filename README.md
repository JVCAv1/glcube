# glcube
  
Project I started to train myself on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming and the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) engine.
  
  
### Planned features:
  
- [x] display cube 
- [ ] input to rotate the cube
- [ ] input to rotate the light direction
- [ ] input to change the cube's color  
...maybe more.
